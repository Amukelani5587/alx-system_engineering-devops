Background Context
Being a Full-Stack Software Engineer means you’re comfortable interacting with any layer of the stack.

A way to easily assess this is to simply ask an engineer to explain how a software system works. They can have a general overview of the flow or can choose to dig deep in a certain area.

Let’s practice by exploring the infrastructure side (network, servers, security…) of the question.
